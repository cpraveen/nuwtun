                          README file for NuWTun
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Contents

src-flo : Flow solver files
src-adj : Adjoint solver files, NOT FINISHED YET
examples: Example test cases
docs    : Manual, license, etc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compiling

You will need a fortran 90 compiler since dynamic memory allocation is used.
Compilation has been tested with gfortran. Set your compiler and flags in
makefile.in and then just type "make". Compilation requires "ar", a program to
create, modify and extract from archives.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Call-tree

If you have ftnchek, then you can generate a call-tree inside the docs/src-flo
directory. Type "make tree" to generate the tree. This has been tested to work
only on GNU/Linux. You can change the location where the call-tree is stored
by changing the CTDIR variable in makefile.in to appropriate value.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Visualization

Nuwtun can output the solution in plot3d format. Plot3d files can be read by
the following visualization softwares:

Tecplot: Commercial software, but probably the best one.

Paraview: Free software, based on VTK, can read only grid and solution files,
not the function file.

Mayavi: Free software, similar to Paraview and is based on VTK. Only 3-D files
can be read.

Calculix: Free software, can read both 2-d and 3-d files, only formatted, can
read grid, solution and function files. It is quite good for 2-D.
