Changes between ISAAC 4.2 and Revision 1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: These are the changes between ISAAC 4.2 and the first version in SVN.
For subsequent changelog, consult the svn log on the nuwtun website or using
the following command

svn log <file/directory name>


makefile: 

Makefile has been rewritten. Important values are passed to makefile through
makefile.in.

Dynamic memory allocation: 

All large real variables are allocated dynamically.  Integer variables are
still allocated statically since these do not occupy much memory. Just set the
max dimensions in header/maxdim.h to sufficiently large values and it should
work.

The code in main/main.F which saves the solution in PLOT3D format has been
moved into a separate subroutine WRTP3D in file io/wrtp3d.F.

CUT3D is modified to average both Q and PROPS. A new subroutine COREDG is
added to assign solution to corner and edge points of a block for PLOT3D
output.

A large number of subroutines have been put into separate files.

Boundary conditions in rhs/bc.F has been moved into separate directory "bc".

Directory structure of "turb" has been changed, there are no sub-directories
now.

Subroutine LIMITR has been modified; a subroutine is added for each limiter in
a new file limfun.F

Subroutine FROE has been modified; it is now called FLUROE and takes only one
left state and one right state. Looping over faces is now in subroutine FDS.

Some code in subroutine BCFAR/BCFR2D has been uncommented; this relates to
turbulence quantities.

In subroutine BCWALL, the Wilcox model is uncommented and Menter model is
commented out.

There is a new include file header/maxdim.h

Convergence history is stored in files
fort.17  : Flow residue history
fort.18  : Cl and Cd history
The file units are determined by the variables IRESID and ICLCD.
